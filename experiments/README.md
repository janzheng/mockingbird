# Experiments

This folder contains experimental scripts that use Groq Compound search for various research and discovery tasks.

## üéØ Quick Start: Best Approach for Academic Papers

For the most accurate results, use:
```bash
deno task ex:phage-therapy-urls-only
```

This uses Groq only for URL discovery, then fetches 100% accurate metadata directly from webpages. See `SOLUTION.md` for why this approach is superior.

## Running Experiments

Each experiment can be run using the deno task command:

```bash
deno task ex:experimentname
```

## Available Experiments

### üèÜ Phage Therapy Papers - URLs Only (RECOMMENDED) (`ex:phage-therapy-urls-only`)

**‚≠ê BEST ACCURACY:** Uses Groq only for URL discovery, then fetches real metadata from webpages.

**Run with:**
```bash
deno task ex:phage-therapy-urls-only
```

**Why this is best:**
- ‚úÖ **100% accurate metadata** - pulled directly from webpage HTML meta tags
- ‚úÖ **No hallucinations** - LLM only finds URLs, not metadata
- ‚úÖ **Complete information** - gets full titles, authors, abstracts, DOIs
- ‚úÖ **Verifiable** - every data point comes from the actual paper's webpage

**What it does:**
1. Uses Groq Compound to search and find paper URLs (domain-restricted)
2. Fetches each webpage directly
3. Extracts citation metadata from HTML meta tags:
   - `citation_title` - Full, accurate titles
   - `citation_author` - All authors
   - `citation_publication_date` - Real publication dates
   - `citation_journal_title` - Correct journal names
   - `citation_doi` - Verified DOIs
   - `citation_abstract` - Actual abstracts

**Output includes:**
- Full untruncated titles
- Author lists (first 5 + "et al.")
- Accurate dates in readable format
- Correct journal names
- DOIs with direct links
- Abstracts (first 300 characters)

**Use this for:**
- Academic citations
- Research reports
- Any situation where accuracy is critical
- When you need complete, verifiable information

### URL Content Verification (`ex:verify-urls`)

**For Deep Verification:** Fetches actual webpage content and compares metadata.

**Run with:**
```bash
deno task ex:verify-urls
```

**What it does:**
- Fetches the actual HTML of papers found by Groq
- Extracts metadata from webpage (citation_title, citation_date, etc.)
- Compares **claimed metadata** vs **actual webpage metadata**
- Shows exactly where discrepancies occur

**Use this when:**
- You need to verify if dates/journals are actually correct
- You suspect Groq is returning wrong metadata

## Anti-Hallucination Strategies

Based on research and testing, here are proven strategies to reduce hallucinations in Groq Compound searches:

### 1. Use `search_settings` to Restrict Domains

Limit searches to reputable sources:

```javascript
search_settings: {
  include_domains: [
    "pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov",
    "nature.com",
    "science.org",
    "*.edu"  // Academic institutions
  ]
}
```

### 2. Two-Step RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Separate retrieval from formatting:

```javascript
// Step 1: Retrieve with strict "don't make up" instructions
const searchResults = await searchWithCompound(query, {
  system: "Find actual papers. Do not make up information.",
  temperature: 0.1
});

// Step 2: Format with verification requirements  
const formatted = await searchWithCompound(`Format these results: ${searchResults}`, {
  system: "Mark unverified items clearly. Be honest about limitations.",
  temperature: 0.1
});
```

### 3. Lower Temperature for Factual Tasks

- Use 0.1-0.3 for research and factual retrieval
- Use 0.7-0.9 only for creative tasks

### 4. Extract and Verify URLs/DOIs

```javascript
// Extract URLs from LLM response
const urls = text.match(/https?:\/\/[^\s\)]+/g);

// Verify each URL
for (const url of urls) {
  const response = await fetch(url, { method: 'HEAD' });
  console.log(url, response.ok ? '‚úÖ' : '‚ùå');
}
```

### 5. Explicit "Do Not Hallucinate" Instructions

Be very explicit in system prompts:
- "Do NOT make up papers or citations"
- "Only include information from actual search results"
- "If you cannot find something, say so explicitly"
- "Include source URLs for everything"

### 6. Display Tool Calls

Check what tools were actually used:

```javascript
if (result.choices[0]?.message?.tool_calls) {
  console.log("Tools used:", result.choices[0].message.tool_calls);
}
```

### 7. Mark Unverified Information

Always distinguish between verified and unverified:
- Papers with URLs: ‚úÖ Verified
- Papers without URLs: ‚ö†Ô∏è [NEEDS VERIFICATION]
- Inaccessible URLs: ‚ùå [BROKEN LINK]

### 8. Provide Manual Verification Methods

Always include fallback verification:
- PubMed search syntax
- Direct links to databases
- Alternative search strategies

## Creating New Experiments

1. Create a new `.js` file in this directory
2. Import the compound search module:
   ```javascript
   import "jsr:@std/dotenv/load";
   import { searchWithCompound } from '../core/search/compound.js';
   ```
3. Write your experiment logic
4. Add a new task to `deno.json`:
   ```json
   "ex:yourexperiment": "deno run --allow-env --allow-net --allow-read ./experiments/yourexperiment.js"
   ```
5. **Consider implementing anti-hallucination strategies** from the section above

## Tips

- Use lower temperatures (0.1-0.3) for factual research tasks
- Use higher temperatures (0.7-0.9) for creative tasks
- Provide detailed system prompts to guide the search
- Use `max_tokens` to control response length
- Check `result.choices[0].message.tool_calls` to see which tools were used
- Groq Compound has access to web search, code execution, browser automation, and more

## Environment Requirements

Make sure you have a `GROQ_API_KEY` in your `.env` file:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
